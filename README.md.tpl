Hi there! I am Alex, known online as `_Ghostboo__` or Ghostboo124 online

My journey in coding started when I was ~7 years old when my Dad gave me a python tutorial to keep me entertained and has since evolved into my coding in rust and python primarily, a bit of osdev and a slight ability to read and understand C.
